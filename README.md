****YouTube API****

An API to fetch latest videos sorted in reverse chronological order of their publishing date-time from YouTube for a given tag/search query in a paginated response.

**Project Goals:**

● Use YouTube API to fetch list of videos of certain search keyword for fetching the latest videos for a predefined search query and store the data of videos (specifically these fields - Video title, description, publishing datetime, thumbnails URLs and any other fields you require) in a database
with proper indexes.

● A GET API which returns the stored video data in a paginated response sorted in
descending order of published datetime.

● A basic search API to search the stored videos using their title and description.

● Project should be scalable and optimized.


The project is based on Django.
